# CSS Advanced Project

## Objectives
This project builds on the HTML, advanced project and focuses on applying CSS styling to create a visually appealing and responsive webpage.

The final design reference is available on Figma. Duplicate the Figma file to your drafts to access all design specifications.

## Resources
- Fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- Images: Download from the project resources
- Design File: Available on Figma

## Notes
- Some design values are floats; rounding is acceptable.
- The HTML structure is based on the HTML, advanced project, with modifications where necessary (e.g., adding logos or images).
- CSS rules will be applied in styles.css to achieve the final look.
